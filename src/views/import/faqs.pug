                p Skull and Roses welcomes and supports the rights and attendance of all persons with disabilities that
                    |  rely on the special skills of a trained service animal. What we DO NOT support, not will tolerate,
                    |  are pets being misrepresented by their owners as service animals, when in fact they are not.
                p 
                    strong Service Animal Definition:
                p A'service animal' means "any dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the
                    |  benefit of an individual with a disability. The work or tasks performed by a service animal must be
                    |  directly related to the handler's disability."
                p Emotional support or comfort animals are not considered service animals under the ADA and
                    |  therefore are not allowed at Skull and Roses.
                p
                    strong Service Animal Policies:
                p For our guests with disabilities who wish to bring their legitimate service animal to Skull and Roses,
                    |  we ask that you review and follow the policies outlined below:
                ol
                    li Service animals must be accompanied by the handler with the disability at all times.
                    li Service animals must be under the control and supervision of their handler at all times.
                    li Service animals are not permitted to be left in camp unattended under any circumstances.
                    li Handlers are required to be prepared for, and clean-up after, their animals at all times.
                    li We reserve the right to remove and/or refuse access to any service animal from the
                        |  campgrounds or venues if that animal is deemed to be a health or safety threat to festival guests,
                        |  staff, or other service animals, or is in violation of the policies listend above.
